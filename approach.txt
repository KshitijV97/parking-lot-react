The parking lot will be of size N

For the sake of simplicity, The parking lot will have two entry/exits for now

I will take N as input from the user from a Textbox

We will generate a Parking lot of size N where all spots have been occupied

Every incoming car can come from either one of the entrances (Front / Rear)
