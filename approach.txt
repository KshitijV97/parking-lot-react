Assumptions: 

1. The parking lot will be of size N (Size will be taken from user)
2. For the sake of simplicity, The parking lot will have two entrances (Front and rear)
3. Initially we will generate a parking lot of size N where the slots have been randomly occupied
3. Every incoming car will be of a random color and registration number and can come from either of the two entrances
4. Incoming car is assigned slot which is closest from the entrance
5. Cars parked in the parking lot can be removed

ReactJS implementation decisions
1. Will maintain state in parent Component and pass it downt to children as props instead of using Redux / Context API
2. Will use simple CSS-in-JS for styling instead of opting for something like styled-components library
3. The viewport will be fixed to 1280px so that the content does not wrap around infinitely 
5. React components, functions will be kept in separate folders
6. Utility functions which are unrelated to functionality will be kept separately
4. Text input taken from user will be debounced


Starting the development
1. Current state of Parking lot will be stored in parentmost component
2. The parent component will have a useEffect listening if the User changes the parking lot size
3. There is a Parking slot component which displays a single parking slot and details of the car parked 
4. There are separate components for queries
5. I am generating all required data randomly by having an array of the sample set and selecting one random element from the array
